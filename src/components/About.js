         I graduated from the University of Rhode Island in Spring 2018 as a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. We only had once course on HTML and JavaScript, so my first real taste of web applications was at an education software startup which used PolymerJS. I was hired as a QA Engineer Intern but I got to do some of the development on the app for accessibility. Now I learn more on Webdev in my own time. It's fascinating to see the user experiences everyone is making on the web, and I'm inspired to keep learning so that I can contribute to that as well.
